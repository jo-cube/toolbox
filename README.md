# toolbox

`toolbox` is a collection of small command-line tools.

The main way to use this repository is to install a released binary for the specific tool you want and run it locally on your machine.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does | Install | Usage docs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hello` | Demo CLI that prints a friendly greeting. | `./scripts/install.sh hello` | This README |
| `ksetoff` | Bootstraps or resets Kafka consumer group offsets for a topic. | `./scripts/install.sh ksetoff` | [`docs/ksetoff.md`](docs/ksetoff.md) |

## Install A Tool

Install the latest release of a tool:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh ksetoff
```

Install to a custom directory:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh ksetoff "$HOME/bin"
```

Install a specific release version:

```sh
VERSION=v0.1.0 ./scripts/install.sh ksetoff
```

Install without cloning the repository:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jo-cube/toolbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- ksetoff
```

The installer currently supports:

- `darwin/arm64`
- `darwin/amd64`

Release assets are published as:

```text
<tool>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
<tool>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
```

## Tool Docs

- `hello`: prints `Hello, world!`
- `ksetoff`: see [`docs/ksetoff.md`](docs/ksetoff.md) for setup, config file format, examples, and troubleshooting

## Use `hello`

```sh
hello
hello --version
```

## For Contributors

Prerequisites:

- Go 1.25.4 or newer
- macOS for the provided installer script

Build all CLIs into `./bin`:

```sh
make build
```

Run tests:

```sh
make test
```

Run from source:

```sh
make run-hello
make run-ksetoff ARGS='-h'
```

Install from source:

```sh
make install-hello
make install-ksetoff
```

GitHub Actions:

- build and test on pushes and pull requests
- cross-build macOS binaries for `amd64` and `arm64`
- publish tarball release assets when a `v*` tag is pushed

To add another CLI later:

1. Create `cmd/<cli-name>/main.go`.
2. Put tool-specific logic in `internal/<cli-name>/`.
3. Add build and install shortcuts to `Makefile` if needed.
4. Update CI and release workflows to package the new CLI.
5. Add the tool to the table above and add dedicated docs when the tool needs more than a short usage note.
